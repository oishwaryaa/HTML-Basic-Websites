<h1>Best Movies of All Time Suggested by Oishwaryaa</h1>
<h2>Here are my top 3 suggestions:</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Interstellar (2014)</h3>
<p>
Nolan's venture into the world of science fiction differentiates itself from most of the genre by focusing more on science than fiction. The film is considered to be one of the most scientifically accurate films of this kind to ever be put on screen. A must watch and 100% recommended by Oishwaryaa.

<h3>2. Baby's Day Out (1994)</h3>
<p>
Baby's Day Out is still an amusing little film to watch, and does manage to make you smile even if the gags aren't as funny as the first time you've seen this film. The cast makes it even more worth watching this film, especially the three kidnappers which are played by Joe Mantegna, Joe Pantoliano and Brian Haley.

<h3>3. Paranormal Activity (2007)</h3>
<p>
A low budget supernatural film, Paranormal Activity is still very scary and will keep you captivated throughout. The best part is that this whole movie has been shot with a hand-held camera like a real documentary,which makes it even more realistic and spine-chilling. Grab some popcorn on a Halloween Night and dare yourself to watch this movie alone.
